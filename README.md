# Worldskill Malaysia Belia 2024 TRAINING

Kongsi Kereta is an eco-friendly ride-sharing app developed for training purposes, aiming to promote sustainability through carpooling. Similar to Grab, it connects riders with driversâ€”but with a unique twist: it focuses entirely on green, shared transportation to help reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions.

Built using Firebase for real-time updates and secure user management, the app provides a smooth, scalable, and efficient user experience. The calming, nature-themed UI reflects the appâ€™s core mission of encouraging eco-conscious travel and supporting a cleaner, greener future.
